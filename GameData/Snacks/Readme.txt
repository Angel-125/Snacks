Snacks! Continued

Original mod by: Troy Gruetzmacher (tgruetzm)
Continuation by: Michael Billard (Angel-125)

Snacks was originally published by Troy Gruetzmacher (tgruetzm) in August of 2014. It offered a novel and lightweight solution to life support for those that didn't want the complexity of more sophisticated mods like TAC Life Support. Two years later, the game has advanced and while the original author appears to have moved on, it was time to give Snacks an update.

Features:
- Friendly, lightweight life support system
- Highly configurable to support your play style
- Optional consequences that won't brick your mission

Snacks Continued retains the simplicity of the original mod while adding new options. You can configure things like snacks consumed per meal, meals per day, enable/disable recycling, recycling efficiency, and various penalties for hungry kerbals including reputation loss, fines, and partial loss of vehicle control. You can even enable/disable random snacking if desired. Just like with the stock CommNet, the penalties won't brick your mission. All of these options are found in the Game Difficulty screen. And if you're new to Snacks Continued, please consult the KSPedia.

REVISION HISTORY

1.3.0

- Snacks now have mass and volume. One unit of Snacks takes up 1 liter and masses 0.001 metric tons. 
- Adjusted the MPL's Snack Processor's Ore to Snacks output to account for mass.
- The Snack Processor's efficiency can be improved by those with the Science skill.
- Added several configurable options to KSP's Game Difficulty screen. 
- If recycling is enabled, then kerbals produce Soil when consuming Snacks. Soil is a 1-liter resource that masses 0.001 metric tons. Apparently Soil was part of tgruetzm's original design...
- If recycling is enabled, then the Hitchhiker can convert Soil into Snacks. You can configure recycling efficiency in the Game Difficulty screen.
- New consequences for missing meals:
  * Pay fines per kerbal
  * Lose partial control of the vessel
- Added three sizes of Snack Tins. They can be switched between storing Snacks, Soil, or both. Models and textures courtesy of SQUAD/Porkjet.
