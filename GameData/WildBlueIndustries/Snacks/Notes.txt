Air and Stress

- Snacks now has the ability to define custom life support resources besides just Snacks! All it takes is a config file. With this feature you can:
  - Define your own life support resource to consume and/or produce.
  - Optionally track its status in the vessel snapshot window- with support in the multithreaded simulator!
  - Optionally apply one or more outcomes (like penalties) if the consumed resource runs out, or if space for the produced resource is full.
As an example of a tracked resource, check out the LifeSupportResources folder for the FreshAir.txt file. Rename it with the .cfg extension to enable it.
NOTE: You can make FreshAir using the stock ISRU and mini ISRU.
