{
	title = Air!
	description = This addon demonstrates how to add a new life support resource that can be tracked and simulated by Snacks. It introduces two new life support resources to contend with: Fresh Air, and Stale Air. <br>Kerbals need Fresh Air to breathe in addition to Snacks to eat. As they exhale, Fresh Air becomes Stale Air. If they run out of Fresh Air, they'll faint and eventually die. You can think of Fresh Air as an immediate concern with Snacks being a longer term issue. <br>All the stock crew cabins have Air Scrubber converters, and the stock ISRU parts can create Fresh Air from Oxidizer. Other mods may provide different converters as well.

It tends to want to want to get into space much more than kerbals do, and may get quite the help if BARIS is around.
