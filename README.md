v0.1 Alpha Features:
--------------
-Snacks are added as a resource to every moudle that can carry crew 100 snacks for each Kerpacity.  The Cupola stores an extra 50 snacks since it has built in storage!
-Snack capacity of non-command modules is 300 snacks for each Kerpacity.
-Kerbals consume about 1 snack per day(Kerbin day).  However since snacks are randomly consumed through out the day, you cannot predicte with certainty how many will be required for a given mission.   There are a few extra twists here as well. Badass kerbals may sneak an extra snack or two. Pack extra! 
-If you deprive a Kerbal of snacks, the next time he attempts to eat snacks, your reputation will go down by 5 points(configurable as KerbalSnackPenalty).  Each subsequent time the Kerbal is deprived your reputation decreases.
