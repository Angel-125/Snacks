Requirements:
--------------
Snacks requires the use of module manager v2.2.1.  The latest version is provided in the release package.

v0.1 Alpha Features:
--------------
-Snacks are added as a resource to every moudle that can carry crew 50 snacks for each Kerpacity. 

-Snack capacity of non-command modules is 200 snacks for each Kerpacity. Some modules may have more or less depending on built in snack compartments, or lack of space!

-Kerbals consume about 1/2 snack per day(Kerbin day).  However since snacks are randomly consumed through out the day, you cannot predicte with certainty how many will be required for a given mission.   There are a few extra twists here as well. 
Some Kerbals may sneak an extra snack at snack time, others may forget to eat if their stupidity is too high.

-If you deprive a Kerbal of snacks, the next time he attempts to eat snacks, your reputation will go down by 1 point.  Each subsequent time the Kerbal is deprived your reputation decreases.
