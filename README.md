Snacks:
--------------
Snacks is a Kerbal Space Program mod that adds a simple life support system based on the resource snacks.  Go ahead stuff the cupola snack modules full, just be careful of Jeb he sometimes doesn't share.

Requirements:
--------------
Snacks requires the use of module manager v2.2.1.  The latest version is provided in the release package.

v0.2 Alpha Features:
--------------
-Snacks are added as a resource to every module that can carry crew 50 snacks per capacity.

-Snack capacity of non-command modules is 200 snacks for each capacity. Some modules may have more or less depending on built in snack compartments, or lack of space!
The idea is that non-command modules are the main means to transport snacks. I expect two hitchhikers and a command module would support a crew of 3 on a manned round trip mission to duna.

-Kerbals randomly consume snacks on average every 3 hours, 1/4 snack each time. This averages to 1/2 snack per Kerbin day or 2 snacks per Earth day. You cannot predict with certainty how many will be required for a given mission. There are a few extra twists here as well. 
Some Kerbals, especially courageous ones may sneak an extra snack at snack time, others may forget to eat if their stupidity is to high.

-Kerbals on EVA take 1 snack with them. This should be enough for about 2 Kerbin days. Plan accordingly.

-If you deprive a Kerbal of snacks, the next time he attempts to eat snacks, your reputation will go down. Each subsequent time the Kerbal is deprived your reputation decreases.
Reputation decrease is based on your current reputation. If you are a reputable space agency, your reputaion will drop faster than a less reputable agency. The exact amount is configurable in snacks.cfg(repLossPercent). The formula is percent(.25% default) * number of hungry kerbals * current Reputation
